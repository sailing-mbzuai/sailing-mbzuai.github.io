# Instructions: Adding Open Source Projects

Note that the open-source page is primarily used for seriously maintained projects. To add a project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new markdown inside `_projects/` with filename `project_{PROJECTNAME}.md` where `{PROJECTNAME}` is the name of the project.
2. Then fill in the markdown file. An example is available at `_projects/project_genamap.md`.
3. For now, use `importance: 10` and `category: project`.
